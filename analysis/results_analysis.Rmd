## R Markdown

```{r cars}
nasa_tlx <- read.csv("../results/nasa_tlx.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
decision_points <- read.csv("../results/decision_points.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
post_trial <- read.csv("../results/post_trial.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
